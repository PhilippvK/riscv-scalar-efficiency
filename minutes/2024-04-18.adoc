== Topics

Charter::

 * Agreed to adopt "targetable by a compiler code generator or builtin/instrinsic" for scope
 ** Derek will update charter, along with note defining builtin/intrinsic

Processor classes::

 * Agreed on four relevant processor classes:
 ** Microcontroller
 ** Low-end in-order application processor (_e.g._, IoT)
 ** Mid-range out-of-order application processor (_e.g._, mobile)
 ** High-end out-of-order application processor (_e.g._, server)
 * All application processors expected to share instructions. Differentiation is for evaluation purposes.
 * Derek will create more complete descriptions of each class

Workloads::

 * Additional workloads were suggested:
 ** Linux Kernel (apps)
 ** Router software (apps)
 ** Crypto
 ** Vendor-proprietary (vendor may share results, without sharing workload)

Metrics::

 * Agreed that metrics will be applied per instruction

Instruction database::

 * Went over fields. Christian suggested a field indicating if there is a known implementation already.
 * Derek encouraged members to contribute
