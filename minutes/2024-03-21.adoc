Charter::

 * Debated whether or not to restrict scope to instructions "targetable by a compiler".
 ** Phillip pointed out that an instruction meant for libc (_e.g._, instruction for working with strings) would be excluded, even though the general consensus is that should be in scope.
 ** No final decision on wording; Derek will talk to Krste, who originally suggested the restriction.
 * Started discussion of relative merit of code size/instruction count vs. performance for inclusion criteria, and how to measure performance
 ** No conclusions; will likely need long deliberation.
 ** Greg suggested defining several baseline microarchitectures (e.g., low, high).
 ** Derek pointed out that relative importance of metrics is going to be profile/market-dependent. 
 * Minor wordsmithing; see charter https://github.com/riscv-admin/riscv-scalar-efficiency/commit/66b0179e911afb0b3a66d582bf0ec688faa934cb[diff].
