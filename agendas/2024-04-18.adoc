== Agenda

 * Update on charter
 * Discuss processor types / metrics / workloads
 * Introduction to instruction database

<<<
== Charter

  * Krste considers instructions expected to be *handwritten and applicable to multiple domains* out of scope.
  * Derek's recommendation:
  ** Revert to *targetable by a compiler code generator or builtin function*
  ** If we discuss any instructions that do not fit that scope, we can assist in setting up a TG under a different SIG/HC/IC.

== Processor types

[%autowidth]
|===
| Microcontroller | App

a|
  . In-order implementation
  . (Relatively) low frequency
  . First-order constraints (metrics):
  ** Static code size
  ** Area
  . Second-order constraints (metrics):
  ** Dynamic code size
  ** Performance
  ** Power
  . Suggested workloads:
  ** EEMBC
  ** Zephyr OS (for code size)?

a|

  . Up to wide out-of-order implementation
  . High frequency
  . First-order constraints (metrics):
  ** Performance
  ** Power
  . Second-order constraints (metrics);
  ** Dynamic code size
  ** Area
  . Third-order constraints (metrics):
  ** Static code size
  . Suggested workloads:
  ** SPEC CPU 2017
  ** Android Open Source Project (AOSP) -- For code size
  ** Speedometer (browser)

== Metrics

Breadth::

  * Workload
  ** Individual benchmark?
  *** What's an "important" benchmark?
  ** Average on a suite?
  * Per-instruction or per-extension?

Code Size::

  * % reduction per codepoint (_e.g._, 1% / 0.1% SROS)?

Performance::

  * Need accepted performance model *or* real hardware (_e.g._ from vendor custom extension)
  * 

<<<
== Instruction database

  * Instruction database has been started:
  a. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dQYU7QQ-SnIoXp9vVvVjS6Jz9vGWhwmsdbEOF3JBwUg/edit#gid=0[Review fields]
  * Looking for contributions

<<<
== Next steps

  * Submit charter + call for Chair/Vice-chair
  * Collect instructions, start dedup + categorizing
  * Discuss methodology
